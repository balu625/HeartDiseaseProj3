     Heart Disease Prediction

Heart disease prediction using machine learning involves analyzing patient health data to predict the likelihood of heart-related conditions. 
Machine learning models are trained on features such as age, blood pressure, cholesterol, chest pain type, heart rate, and ECG results. 
Algorithms like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines, and Neural Networks are commonly used.

Machine learning algorithms like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Support Vector Machines are trained on labeled datasets
(e.g., Cleveland Heart Disease dataset) to recognize patterns associated with heart conditions.
